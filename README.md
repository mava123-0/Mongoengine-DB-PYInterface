Interface for managing a Shop Database with 'category' and 'products' as collections in the MongoDB. Made using Mongoengine concept in Python.

Mongoengine:
To use MongoEngine, you will need to download MongoDB and ensure it is running in an accessible location. You will also need PyMongo to use MongoEngine, but if you install MongoEngine using setuptools, then the dependencies will be handled for you.
MongoEngine is available on PyPI, so you can use pip:
python -m pip install mongoengine

Requirements:
Mongoengine Installed.
Requires a database named ShopDB in MongoDB in your localhost to connect using Mongoengine.
You can perform the CRUD operations on the Database using this interface.
